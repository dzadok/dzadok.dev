# Progress?

Today I added a few links. These are just text right now, but will probably be replaced with icons later.
I also changed some of the DOM elements to use semantic tags instead of divs.

## Not so much

It's hard to find a lot of time for personal coding projects with a two-year old. It seems that he's cutting three canine teeth at once, so that is fun.
Sounds like nap time is over.
