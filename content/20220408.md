# Progress

I haven't done a whole lot more. I did manage to use [react-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown) to display the markdown. There's no formatting yet, and I still need to figure out i18n for the dates. I did figure out a component test for the markdown conversion in cypress. However, I should still be testing a few more things, I think. There's also some areas that could benefit from some refactoring.
