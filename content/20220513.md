# Automation

I've been working on trying to get some automation in place, using Github Actions. I was able to deploy the site automatically on pushes to main.
I' working on converting these blog posts from markdown to a simple bit of json that I can use with firestore, and then actually sending them to firestore.
Once that's in place I'll be able to remove the current code that relies on vite to import the markdown files, and make api calls for the blog posts.
I was making some decent progress at figuring out github actions, but my son woke up after only an hour and a half asleep, and was not very happy to fall back asleep.
