# Waterfalls

After a few days off, I decided to check my page load performance. I found the dreaded waterfall of repeated sequential requests. Upon review, I realized I was loading all the blog posts sequentially on page load, instead of just the one I wanted. Oops. Looking at the code it was very obvious, that I was doing exactly that in a useEffect hook. So, I spent a bit of time today, reworking that logic, to make sure I only loaded the currently displayed blog post, while tracking which posts we already had, so we could redisplay those from memory, instead of going to Firestore again. I probably should have tracked how much page load was improved by, but it's a function of how many blog posts there are, so it would have gotten worse over time, anyway.
