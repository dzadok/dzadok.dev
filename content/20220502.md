# Light/Dark Toggle

At the risk of being a bit cliche, I intend to add a light/dark mode toggle. I've added just about everthing except the actual toggle.
I did however, add a bunch of code that should have been TDD, but was not. I suspect, I'll only ever get good this with a pair to keep me honest. I can at least go back and write some tests.
