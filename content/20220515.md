# Eclipse

Tonight there was a total lunar eclipse. I had never bothered to watch one before, as I figured that I had already seen the phases of the moon, so how different could this be? It was actually quite a wonderful event. There's a moment where you can see the last bit of light flicker in and out that should not be missed.

I think the format I initially chose for the blog posts in firestore will work fine `{Title, Date, Content}`, however I do want to get access to a list of posts, so I think I'll create a new document that just has one field that's an array of posts. That won't provide the greatest scaling, but I with my file name convention limiting me to one blog post per day, I don't think I'll have to worry about, so simpler is better, here.
