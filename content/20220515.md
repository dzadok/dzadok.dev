# Eclipse

Tonight there was a total lunar eclipse. I had never bothered to watch one before, as I figured that I had already seen the phases of the moon, so how different could this be? It was actually quite a wonderful event. There's a moment where you can see the last bit of light flicker in and out that should not be missed. I would have liked to see my son's reaction, but it wasn't worth waking him up, after the rough couple of nights he had. He had already woken up after about twenty minutes, and I managed to get him back in his crib, so I wasn't going to disturb him.

I think the format I initially chose for the blog posts in firestore will work fine `{Title, Date, Content}`, however I do want to get access to a list of posts, so I think I'll create a new document that just has one field that's an array of posts. That won't provide the greatest scaling, but I with my file name convention limiting me to one blog post per day, I don't think I'll have to worry about, so simpler is better, here.
