# Style

I got my light/dark toggle working, and spent some time working on CSS to make it pretty. It's certainly overkill, but it was fun.
I was also able to get things looking good on actual mobile devices. The layout that dev tools showed for mobile emulation did not previously match what appeared on my cell phone, but with a few changes, I was able to correct those problems. I've also used VisBug to check that I have enough contrast on all elements to meet AAA usability
