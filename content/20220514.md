# Let's See Some Action

Last night was even worse than the night before. My son woke up early again, and was extremely irritable. He didn't know what he wanted at all, but it certainly wasn't to go back to bed. Even after I finally gave up and took him into bed with me, he spent a long time doing acrobatics in bed, then woke up early and wanted a large breakfast. Maybe he was hungry already last night?

I managed to get an action that runs, but so far it is not updating Firestore. I am hoping that this blog post will update Firestore when I push the commit, but if not I at least added some logging to the action to get an idea of what's going on when looking at the job summary.

As I was typing that last sentence he passed out in my arms, so we took a brief nap, then I had breakfast and he had a snack. Now, I'm back to trying to get a Github action to send a document to Firestore.

I only had a brief period of time to work on this some more, then we had to go out and help mama with weeding, but it was too sunny, and even with sunblock we could only stay out a few minutes. Then we did laps around the kitchen island for almost a whole hour, and now it's time for lunch. Let's hope he takes a good, long nap today.

I managed to get a document into Firestore through a Github Action, now I need to see about getting it in a good format.
