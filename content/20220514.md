# Action!

Last night was even worse than the night before. My son woke up early again, and was extermely irritable. He didn't know what he wanted at all, but it certainly wasn't to go back to bed. Even after I finally gave up and took him into bed with me, he spent a long time doing acrobatics in bed, then woke up early and wanted a large breakfast. Maybe he was hungry already last night?

I managed to get an action that runs, but so far it is not updating Firestore. I am hoping that this blog post will update Firestore when I push the commit, but if not I at least added some logging to the action to get an idea of what's going on when looking at the job summary.
